** Lab1 Analysis **

Create a program with 3 decalred integer variables and one integer pointer

the program will print out the following:
    value of a variable
    variable’s address
    value of a pointer that points to that variable
    the value at the location that the pointer is pointing to

After you print the information change the variable by using the pointer and print it again.

 
** Lab1 Design **

Create and initialize each integer and the pointer

Print:
    "value of var: " + myVar 
    "address of var: " + &myVar 
    "value of pointer: " + myVarPointer 
    "value at location pointer references: " + *myVarPointer 

*myVarPointer = newValue

print again

*pointer = nextInt
    
Wash. Rinse. Repeat starting at print statements for each different variable. 
use the same pointer

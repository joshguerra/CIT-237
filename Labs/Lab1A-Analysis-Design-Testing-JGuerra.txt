** Lab1A Analysis **

Create a program that can print out the following:
    value of a variable
    variable’s address
    value of a pointer that points to that variable
    the value at the location that the pointer is pointing to

After you print the information change the variable by using the pointer and print it again.
Repeat the above once for each variable type: 
    character
    int
    double
    float
    short
    long

 
** Lab1A Design **

Create and initialize each variable and its pointer

Print:
    "value of var: " + myVar 
    "address of var: " + &myVar 
    "value of pointer: " + myVarPointer 
    "value at location pointer references: " + *myVarPointer 

*myVarPointer = newValue
    
Wash. Rinse. Repeat starting at print statements for each different variable and its corresponding pointer.
